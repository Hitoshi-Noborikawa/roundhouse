//! A missing prerequisite: the one way a test that needs more than Rust
//! (a gem for a native Rails control, a Ruby on PATH, a native compiler)
//! says it did not run.
//!
//! A test that skips passes, and nextest keeps a passing test's output to
//! itself, so a skip printed with `eprintln!` reaches neither the CI log
//! nor the JUnit report: the test reads as run. `missing(what)` keeps the
//! plain `cargo test` that needs only Rust, and makes a skip visible:
//!
//! - `ROUNDHOUSE_SKIP_LOG=<file>` appends `<test>\t<what>` to that file,
//!   which CI publishes in the job summary.
//! - `ROUNDHOUSE_REQUIRE_PREREQUISITES=1` fails the test as well, for a
//!   run that provides everything and so must not skip anything; the log
//!   still names it.
//!
//! The caller returns after it, as it did after its `eprintln!`.
//! PostgreSQL has its own pair (`pg_test_url.rs`), which predates this.
